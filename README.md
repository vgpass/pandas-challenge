## **Results**

I believe I sucessfully completed the challenge. My Jupyter notebook has been updated to create the requested data frames, and I spent some time learning how to use Markup cells to give my notebook a nicer appearance.

## **Comments and Thoughts**

Overall, I'm happy with my final product. Most of my biggest issues had to do with getting the syntax right. I was stuck early on, but worked through those issues. I was getting a lot of KeyErrors and ValueErrors, but the class instruction on finding and eliminating errors was super helpful. I need to spend more time in this area. I was a little confused about what was required for the final product since a Jupyter notebook obviously isn't something you would hand to a school board as your final data presentation. I hope that my markup code makes my work clearer and more understandable and ties it all together.

I plan to spend more time studying the groupby and indexing features. I didn't use .loc at all, and I'm wondering if I missed something or just found other ways to pull the data I needed. I confess I did come up with one major work around. I was having such a hard time getting some of my later groupby statements to work. I kept getting a base(10) integer error. I knew it had to do with converting a string to an interger, but I could not get my code to work. I pivoted and decided instead to create copies of the data frames I needed and place those before I did any formatting. (This dawned on me when I was out for an early morning run.) In this way, I had clean, unformatted data ready to use when I needed it. I am going to spend some more time working out how to convert strings to integers, even when they contain dollar or percentage signs. I've no doubt that will come in handy at some point.
