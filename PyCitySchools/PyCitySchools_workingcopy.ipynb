    "# PyCity Schools Analysis\n",
    "### Presented by Vincent Passanisi\n",
    "### November 7, 2022\n",
    "\n",
    "**Backgound**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the summer of 2022, the PyCity School Board funded a report to analyze the test scores of the fifteen high schools that comprise the PyCity school district. The purpose of this report was to analyze student acheivement post Covid-required school shutdowns. Now that schools have fully re-opened, and students have returned to a normal schedule, we would like to assess the impact of school shut-downs across the district, and point the way toward instituting policies that will ensure student success across all demographic categories. Our analysis looks at state-administered test scores in reading and math. This report is meant to simply summarize the data and point out its most obvious conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**District Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyCity school district is comprised of 15 high schools with a total student population of almost 40,000 students. The total budget for the district is roughly 24.5 million dollars. There are two types of schools in the city: district schools, of which there are seven, and charter schools which number eight. 26,976 students attend the district schools, which is roughly seven out of ten. 12,194 attend the district's charter schools. Over 70% of the district's budget goes to district schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "**Presentation of Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data below is summarized in eight tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* District Summary\n",
    "* School Summary\n",
    "* Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\n",
    "* Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)\n",
    "* Math Scores by Grade\n",
    "* Reading Scores by Grade\n",
    "* Scores by School Spending\n",
    "* Scores by School Size\n",
    "* Scores by School Type\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schools with a *smaller* student population outperformed schools with larger student populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Schools with *smaller* budgets per student also outperformed schools with more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every charter school outperformed *every* district school. The lowest five performing schools were district schools, while the highest performing schools were all charter schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most evident conclusion is that charter schools vastly outperformed district schools. In addition, those schools did so with fewer resources, although it must be noted that they also had smaller student populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recommendations**\n",
    "\n",
    "More analysis will be necessary to determine why it is that charter schools are outperforming district schools. It may simply be that schools are able to better concentrate limited resources with a small school population. It would be necessary to analyze class size in all schools to determine if the student to teacher ratio is the factor that is most predictive of student success. Although the immediate response seems to point toward establishing more charter schools, it will be important to analyze other factors such as student demographics, school culture, teacher demographics, and administrative support. These should be assessed against the qualities shown to improve student performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those factors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* More time in school.\n",
    "* How schools recruit, retain, and develop teachers.\n",
    "* Using data to inform instruction.\n",
    "* Small group tutoring (our analysis may already point to this as a factor in the charter school success).\n",
    "* Developing a culture of high expectations.\n",
